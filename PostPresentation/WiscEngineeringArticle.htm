            <p>Early Thursday afternoon at Engineering Expo, elementary 
and middle school students gathered around a glass display, behind which
 robotic hands moved unnaturally fast along a makeshift assembly line. 
Children crowded the area around the Engineering Centers Building 
entrance, excitedly asking questions about the robot and its functions.</p>
<p>Jane Feller, a representative for the Madison automation-assembly 
company Isthmus: Engineering and Manufacturing, explained that the 
robots are made to pick up objects along an assembly line with magnetic 
arms.</p>
<p>“Kids love the robots. They love seeing moving parts,” Feller said. 
“The big questions are what these robots are really for, and what’s 
picking the objects up.”</p>
<p>With a varied mixture of industry and student displays, the 2015 
Engineering Expo, a biennial student-organized "open house" held April 
14-17 on the UW-Madison engineering campus, offered everything from 
lessons on hydrophobic molecules to scientific explanations of toilet 
flushing. K-12 students wandered Engineering Mall on Thursday and Friday
 in a seemingly limitless search for their next learning adventure.</p>
<p>In Engineering Hall, students Alex Buehler, Jimmy Hermann and Pravin 
Yadab explained the benefits of a 3-D printer to passing children, who 
were fascinated by the technology.</p>
<p>“The kids from elementary school and middle school were just like, 
‘This is amazing,’ Yadab said. “There were no stupid questions.”</p>
<p>Children were encouraged to take a short quiz on their knowledge, and
 if they scored well, they could receive a small souvenir, a tiny cube 
produced by the printer.</p>
<p>“Kids like it. It’s instant gratification,” Yadab said. “They have good questions, like whether you can print pizza with it.”</p>
<p>Many children were curious to learn how these types of technology 
function, as well as their cost. Such questions were ubiquitous at the 
event, as young students displayed an infinite curiosity and desire to 
learn.</p>
<p>Other displays were more industry-oriented, teaching kids the 
applications of science in everyday life. For instance, Kohler Engines 
representatives explained the mechanics of a touchless toilet flush, and
 acted as DJs for kids who wanted to try out the music-playing bathtub. A
 mechanical engineering student who co-ops with Kohler, Jessica Grev, 
enjoyed working with the kids, who showed a strong interest in and 
excitement for their surroundings.</p>
            <div class="photoleft" style="width:px; display:none;">
                
                <div class="caption">
                    
                    
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>“My favorite part is the kids’ reactions to some of the 
stuff,” she said. “They’re pretty fun. Three to four kids would get into
 the tub and request songs; I played ‘Fireworks’ by Katy Perry 
yesterday. They’re pretty interested.”</p>
<p>Expo also gives engineering students a chance to showcase their 
innovative ideas and engineering creations to a larger audience. 
Electrical engineering undergrad James Choncholas came up with a 
Pandora-like software called Miracle that uses the number-based 
qualities of song to classify and group music. As students watched the 
noise frequencies of “Uptown Funk”—an Expo favorite, according to 
Choncholas—flash across a computer screen, the computer was able to do 
mathematical operations to group this song with other, similar songs.</p>
<p>New ideas like Miracle are what give visitors a sense of what 
students are capable of through their university education, and how they
 use their own hobbies and interests to inform their learning.</p>
<p>Engineering students were able to use Expo as an opportunity to teach
 younger students what they’re doing at the university, creating a 
foundation for future interest in engineering fields. In the front lobby
 of the Mechanical Engineering Building, the Wisconsin Robotics Team 
allowed young kids to control a robot the team would have typically used
 for national competitions. While younger kids took advantage of this 
element, older students were more eager to learn the structural and 
technical components of the robots, according to student Stephen Eick.</p>
<p>“Some kids ask really good questions, like, ‘So this is a 
differential suspension you’re using here, right?’ I didn’t know that 
when I was 12,” Eick said.</p>
<p>As children wandered the halls of engineering on Friday afternoon, 
UW-Madison students reflected on the experience and the opportunity to 
impact young minds.</p>
<p>“It’s great to be able to help inspire them,” Eick said.</p>
